Group 10 assignment3

For assignment3, we chose “Peter Pan” as our txt file.


# Extract_words.py Script

Since there are a lot of words that appeared once or twice and it would be to large on the graph, we decided to divide the amount by 5 and assign it to the variable f. If the word frequency is very low, we set a  certain value to measure the size of bar graph. Moreover, the color value will be an increasing value, so the color will slowly changed and in the end, it will be blue.

# Wordle
We made a wordle word cloud image that is a colorful composition of the most frequent words that appear in the PeterPan,txt text file. The bigger the words, the more frequently they appear in the text. 

# Unique Words Visualization
This is another colorful visualization of the text that basically takes in all of the unique words form the uniquewords.txt file and tries to fit as many of them as possible in a 600x700 window. The unique words chosen to be displayed are random and
