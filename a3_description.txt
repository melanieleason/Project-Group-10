Group 10 assignment3

For assignment3, we chose “Peter Pan” as our txt file.


Extract_words.py
It basically extract all files in the PeterPan.txt and generate three files which include all words.txt, uniquewords.txt and wordfrequency.txt. All of the words in these three files appear in the novel Peter Pan.

a3_wordfrequency.pde
With the data from the word frequency.txt, we create a bar graph to show the word frequency appeared in the PeterPan. This showed the distribution of the words in a more visually appealing manner. If the word frequency is very low, we used certain value to measure the size of bar graph. Moreover, the color value will be a increasing value, so the color will slowly changed and in the end, it will be the blue.
