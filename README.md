# Group 10 assignment3
For Assignment 3, the first thing that needs to be checked is that all the files (extract_words.py,allwords.txt, PeterPan.txt,a3_descriotion,Readme.md and PeterPan.wordle.png ) are in the same folder .

Once this is checked, run extract_words.py and it will generate allwords.txt, uniquewords.txt, and wordfrequency.txt.

Then, open the a3_novelvisualization.pde and a3_wordfrequency.pde files in the Processing and hit the 'play' button.  This will produce a word cloud and a bar graph.
