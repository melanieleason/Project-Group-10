For Assignment 3, the first thing that needs to be checked is that all the files (extract_words.py, allwords.txt, PeterPan.txt, a3_description.txt, README.md, PeterPan.wordle.png, the a3_visualization directory that contains a3_visualization.pde, the uniquewords.txt file, and the font file, and the directory called a3_wordfrequency that contains the a3_wordfrequency.pde and the wordfrequency.txt files) are in the same folder .

The .txt files have already been created using the script and they are all already in their respective directories. If the python script needs to be run, just open extract_words.py and hit run and the text files should be generated in the same directory as the script file. They have to be moved to their correct directories to be used in the other parts of the project (it is specified above in the descirption of the files).

Then, open the a3_novelvisualization.pde and a3_wordfrequency.pde files in the Processing and hit the 'play' button.  This will produce a word cloud and a bar graph. You can also click the .png image to view the wordle that we have created.
